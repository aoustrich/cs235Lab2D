How
does
a
bastard
orphan
son
of
a
whore
and
a
Scotsman
dropped
in
the
middle
of
a
forgotten
spot
in
the
Caribbean
by
Providence
impoverished
in
squalor
grow
up
to
be
a
hero
and
a
scholar
The
Ten
dollar
founding
father
without
a
father
got
a
lot
farther
by
working
a
lot
harder
by
being
a
lot
smarter
by
being
a
selfstarter
by
fourteen
they
placed
him
in
charge
of
a
trading
charter
And
every
day
while
slaves
were
being
slaughtered
and
carted
away
across
the
waves
he
struggled
and
kept
his
guard
up
Inside
he
was
longing
for
something
to
be
a
part
of
the
brother
was
ready
to
beg
steal
borrow
or
barter
Then
a
hurricane
came
and
devastation
rained
our
man
saw
his
future
dripdripping
down
the
drain
put
a
pencil
to
his
temple
connected
it
to
his
brain
and
he
wrote
his
first
refrain
a
testament
to
his
pain
Well
the
word
got
around
they
said
this
kid
is
insane
man
took
up
a
collection
just
to
send
him
to
the
mainland
Get
your
education
dont
forget
from
whence
you
came
And
the
world
is
gonna
know
your
name
Whats
ya
name
man
Alexander
Hamilton
My
name
is
Alexander
Hamilton
And
theres
a
million
things

But

When

was

his
father
split
Full
of
it
debtridden
Two
years
later
see
Alex
and
his
mother
bedridden
Halfdead
sittin
in
their
own
sick
the
scent
thick
And
Alex
got
better
but
his
mother
went
quick
Moved
in
with
a
cousin
the
cousin
committed
suicide
Left
him
with
nothin
but
ruined
pride
Somethin
new
inside
A
voice
saying
Alex
you
gotta
fend
for
yourself
He
started
retreatin
and
readin
every
treatise
on
the
shelf
There
wouldve
been
nothin
left
to
do
For
someone
less
astute
He
wouldve
been
dead
and
destitute
Without
a
cent
of
restitution
Started
workin
clerkin
for
his
late
mothers
landlord
Tradin
sugar
cane
and
rum
and
other
things
he
cant
afford
Scannin
for
every
book
he
can
get
his
hands
on
Plannin
for
the
future
see
him
now
as
he
stands
on
The
bow
of
a
ship
headed
for
a
new
land
In
New
York

can
be
a
new
man

Alexander
Hamilton
America
Sings

you
overcame
Do

name
The
world

never

the
same
oh
The
ship
is
in
the
harbor
now
See
if
you
can
spot
him
Another
immigrant
comin
up
from
the
bottom
His
enemies
destroyed
his
rep
America

We

Hey

scrappy
and

And
Im
not

my
shot
Im
a
get
a
scholarship
to
Kings
College
I
probly
shouldnt
brag
but
dag
I
amaze
and
astonish
The
problem
is
I
got
a
lot
of
brains
but
no
polish
I
gotta
holler
just
to
be
heard
With
every
word
I
drop
knowledge
Im
a
diamond
in
the
rough
a
shiny
piece
of
coal
Tryin
to
reach
my
goal
My
power
of
speech
unimpeachable
Only
nineteen
but
my
mind
is
older
These
New
York
City
streets
get
colder
I
shoulder
Evry
burden
evry
disadvantage
I
have
learned
to
manage
I
dont
have
a
gun
to
brandish
I
walk
these
streets
famished
The
plan
is
to
fan
this
spark
into
a
flame
But
damn
its
getting
dark
so
let
me
spell
out
the
name
ALEXANDER
we
aremeant
to
be
A
colony
that
runs
independently
Meanwhile
Britain
keeps
shittin
on
us
endlessly
Essentially
they
tax
us
relentlessly
Then
King
George
turns
around
runs
a
spending
spree
He
aint
ever
gonna
set
his
descendants
free
So
there
will
be
a
revolution
in
this
century
Enter
me
He
says
in
parentheses
Dont
be
shocked
when
your
histry
book
mentions
me
I
will
lay
down
my
life
if
it
sets
us
free
Eventually

see
my
ascendancy
And
I
am
not
throwing
away
My
shot
